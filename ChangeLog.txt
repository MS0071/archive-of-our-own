Created several layout files titled: 
Story-layout
Other-layout
homepage-layout
Fandom-layout
Books-and-lit-layout
movies-layout
Music-and-bands-layout
Each component has a .ts, .css, and a .html file 


added the corresponding paths to the app.routing.model.ts
the default page is the homepage

Moved the storycards and the filter bar to the Story-layout so they would be there and not the homepage
